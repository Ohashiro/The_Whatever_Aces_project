    First of all, you have to select <b>your own home country</b>. From this point, we will be comparing this country to the rest of the world.
    
    <div class="about_section">
        <br><br><b>Countries health system efficiency</b>
        <br>The first part is dedicated to the health indicators (HAQ index, HDI index and life expectancy). 
        It gives you an idea of the health quality and access of the countries, compared to your country.
        To do this, the top charts give an overview of the 3 health indicators and the bottom chart gives a more detailed view of the distribution of the HAQ score.
        <br>
        You can filter the countries depending on their GDP/capita, to see how well you country is doing compared to similar country (economically speaking).
        You can also select some specific countries to compare them.

    <div class="about_section">
        <br><br><b>Health system characteristics of countries</b>
        <br>The goal of the second part is to give insights on interesting factors that impact the health system level. 
        We decided to focus of financial investments because the goal is to help executives get pratical ideas to improve their health care system.
        Therefore we selected 8 examples of medical indicators that can be improved by financial investments.

    <b>Limitations/To go further</b>
    <br>For this project, we decided to focus on 8 specific medical indicators, but others may be as interesting as ours.
    Also, one has to bear in mind that this is a simplistic explanation of medical and health care system, and the reality is far more complex 
    (and implies more complex interactions between stakeholders).
