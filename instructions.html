    <br>
    First of all, you have to select <b>your own home country</b>. From this point, we will be comparing this country to the rest of the world.
    <br>
    Then the page is divided in 2 sections
    <br>
    <div class="about_section">
        <br><br><b>Is your health system efficient ?</b>
        <br>The first part is dedicated to the health indicators (HAQ index, HDI index and life expectancy). 
        It gives you an idea of the health quality and access of the countries, compared to your country.
        To do this, the top charts give an overview of the 3 health indicators and the bottom chart gives a more detailed view of the distribution of the HAQ score.
        <br>
        You can filter the countries depending on their GDP/capita, to see how well you country is doing compared to similar country (economically speaking).
        You can also select some specific countries to compare them.

    </div>

    <div class="about_section">
        <br><br><b>How to improve your health system ?</b>
        <br>The goal of the second part is to give insights on interesting factors that impact the health system level. 
        We decided to focus of financial investments because the goal is to help executives get pratical ideas to improve their health care system.
        Therefore we selected 8 examples of medical indicators that can be improved by financial investments.
        We chose to focus on three main axis:
        <ul>
          <li>- the level of your infrastructure(number of beds and hospitals)</li>
          <li>- your medical training(number of medical schools, average remunerations)</li>
          <li>- the personal and governmental spendings in your country</li>
        </ul>
        You can see how your own country is situated on these indicators (red line),
        but you can also compare it to the world average and other countries.

            style="float:left;width:98%;"
        />
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>Limitations/To go further</b>
    <br>One of the biggest limitations of our project is the data. A lot of data is missing, especially
    on the radar chart. Consequently, this chart limits the analysis to well developed countries only.
    This analysis remains interesting, but it would be even more accurate to add more developing countries.
    <br>For this project, we decided to focus on 8 specific medical indicators, but others may be as interesting as ours.
    <br>Also, one must bear in mind that this is a simplistic explanation of the medical and health care 
    system, and the reality is far more complex (and implies more complex interactions between stakeholders).
     For example, a country at war can have a low life expectancy that cannot be tackled no matter the
     number of medical schools the country builds. Medical system development is crucial, but needs to
     be accompanied by food security, peace, etc.
