    <b>Motivations</b>
    <p style="color:rgb(74, 74, 74)">
        The health care system is a crucial part of each modern country. 
        Nowadays, it is hard to imagine any country which can successfully work without it.
         Even though in recent years medicine has developed at a significant pace, there are still 
         a lot of countries which have significant problems with it. Millions of people in 
         different parts of the earth suffer from the poor level of care system in their countries. 
         However, the access to quality healthcare is vital to the survival of every individual. 
         Even developed countries like the USA and France have issues with it. To date, France has a 
         lack of medical personnel while the USA has a really expensive health care system for 
         individuals. All of these factors might influence the health index of each country. 
         The goal of this study, to find out these factors. 
      </p>
    This is why we find crucial to raise awareness on decisive financial investments that impact a country's health system.
    This motivated us to create a visualisation dashboard with the goal of answering the following questions:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>What is the relationship between money invested in Health</b> (in Health care, in medical staff and equipment, and in medical schools) <b>and health system development level</b> (meaning health access and quality index, health index and life expectancy)<b>?</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>What financial investments in health is correlated to an improvement in the health system development level of a country ?</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Our goal is to help exectives and associations improve their country's medical system, as well as to raise awareness on such questions.
    <!-- <b>The visualizations</b>
    <br>
        The current visualization represents the dependency of the healthcare index on 
        different factors, such as gross domestic product, 
        location, government health expenses, number of medical schools, and so on.
        Such a visualization might be interesting for researchers who work in the field of medical improvement. 
        Furthermore, the information might be useful for government workers who are responsible for the medical sector in their 
        countries(for instance, Ministry of Health employees).
